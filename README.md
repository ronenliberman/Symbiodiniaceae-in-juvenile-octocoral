# Repository for Juvenile octocorals acquire similar algal symbiont assemblages across depths

Liberman, Voolstra, Hume, and Benayahu, Coral reefs, 2024.

ITS2 sequences files in this repository were derived from the Symportal pipeline. 

Additionally, raw psbA sequences that were used to construct the phylogenetic tree of Cladocopium are provided as an aligned fasta document in raw_files.rar\raw_files\TREE_psbA\raw_data\all.psba.no27.wc3gulf.aligned.fasta
